## History of FlowPlayer

The original [FlowPlayer for SailfishOS (2015 - 2016)](https://openrepos.net/content/cepiperez/flowplayer-0#content) started as a port of [FlowPlayer for MeeGo-Harmattan (2014)](https://openrepos.net/content/cepiperez/flowplayer#content).  Both were solely written by [Matias Perez (CepiPerez)](https://github.com/CepiPerez).  In 2021 Matias [released the source code of FlowPlayer](https://github.com/sailfishos-applications/flowplayer/commits/master?after=c4f36e1cb3a80b7c7b220a379c9bdaca3a300113+49) by creating this git repository at GitHub.

In 2023 [olf (Olf0)](https://github.com/Olf0) overhauled infrastructure aspects, such as this README, a [new OpenRepos page](https://openrepos.net/content/olf/flowplayer#content), the [Transifex integration](https://github.com/sailfishos-applications/flowplayer/pull/7), making the spec file suitable for [the Sailfish-OBS](https://build.sailfishos.org/) and [the SailfishOS:Chum community repository](https://build.sailfishos.org/project/show/sailfishos:chum) etc.
